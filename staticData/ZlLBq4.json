"## Usage\n\nFirst, identify the icon that you want to use. You can see the full list of icons\n[here](/materialish/icons/catalog).\n\nLet's assume that we want the `wifi_lock` icon. Each icon's path within the\n`materialish` project is prefixed with `icon-`, and underscores are replaced\nwith hyphens.\n\nAccordingly, `wifi_lock` can be found at `materialish/icon-wifi-lock`:\n\n```jsx\nimport IconWifiLock from 'materialish/icon-wifi-lock';\n```\n\n## Props\n\n| Prop Name | Default Value | Required | Description                                      |\n| --------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| size      | \"1rem\"        | No       | The size of the SVG                              |\n| ...rest   |               | No       | Other props are placed on the root `svg` element |\n\n## Performance\n\nYou may be wondering why each icon is shipped as an individual Component, rather\nthan as a single one. The reason is performance. Providing individual\nComponents allows you to pull in _just_ the SVG code that you need.\n\nIf performance is not an issue for you, then you can opt into importing all of the\nComponents using an alternative import syntax:\n\n```js\nimport { IconWifiLock } from 'materialish/icons';\n```\n\nYou may find this syntax preferable from a developer experience perspective, but keep in mind that you\nwill likely be importing every icon that Material provides. This could have a considerable impact on your\nbundle size, as there are roughly one thousand icons.\n"
